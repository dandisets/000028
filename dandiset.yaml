description: A 10 minute Neuropixels recording simulated using the MEArec Python package
  (Buccino et al., 2020). The recording contains the spiking activity of 250 biophysically
  detailed neurons (200 excitatory and 50 inhibitory cells from the Neocortical Micro
  Circuit Portal with independent Poisson firing patterns, and additive Gaussian noise
  with 10uV standard deviation.
